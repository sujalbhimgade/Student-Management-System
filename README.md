# Student Management System in C++

This project is a **Student Management System** implemented in C++. It allows users to perform various operations such as adding, displaying, searching, deleting, and modifying student records. The program also provides a "trash" feature to store deleted records temporarily for later recovery if needed.

## Features:
1. **Add Student Records**: Input student details such as Admission Number, Name, Gender, Class, and Marks.
2. **Display Records**: View all student records stored in the file.
3. **Search by Admission Number**: Search for a specific studentâ€™s details using the admission number.
4. **Delete Records**: Move unwanted records to a trash file, which can later be restored if necessary.
5. **View Deleted Records**: Access and view student records from the trash.
6. **Modify Student Records**: Update existing student information using the admission number.

## File Handling:
- The project uses **binary files** for storing and managing student data (`Students.dat`) and a trash file (`TrashStud.dat`) for deleted records.

## How to Run:
1. Clone this repository.
2. Compile and run the C++ program in your environment using any C++ compiler (e.g., g++, Visual Studio).
3. Follow the menu-driven interface to perform various operations.
